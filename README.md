# Harambe printer

This repository contains the design of a 3d printer. The printer is very 
similar to a Prusa MK3 with the Bear upgrade. The differences are

* 12mm smooth rods on Z and Y axis for extra rigidity
* 9mm belts on all axes
* Duet2 for control
* Cast aluminium bed with silicon 220V heater
* Self-aligning linear bearings on Z and Y axis

The target I am aiming for is a very reliable, easy to service 3d printer. 

I designed all the 3d printed parts as an exercise to learn 3d modeling and 
mecanical design.
